# Pi Covid-19 Tracker

Because I couldn't find one that shows me at a glance what's the current trend in the World and in the United States.
Why Pi*anything? Because I use my Raspberry Pi 4 as a development server.

Deployment: Just download covid.html and world.jpg to any local folder and open html file. There is no deployment.
